	text: [
		'In a bizarre and hilarious turn of events, a Franco-Floridian individual has decided to quit their high-paying IT job to focus on a niche passion: producing AI-generated articles about Spanish people buying houses in Brussels. This unconventional career move has left colleagues and the internet in stitches.',

		"The individual, identified as Jean-Michel Florida (a name that reflects their dual heritage), claims that this unusual venture was inspired by an AI model that accidentally generated a story about a Spanish family's house-hunting adventure in the Belgian capital. The story, filled with humorous cultural mishaps, was so entertaining that Jean-Michel decided to capitalize on it.",

		'"I was scrolling through some AI-generated content when I stumbled upon this gem of a story," Jean-Michel explained. "I laughed so hard, I almost spilled my caf√© au lait on my Floridian alligator-print shirt. That\'s when I knew I had to pursue this full-time."',

		'The articles, primarily generated by artificial intelligence, are curated by Jean-Michel, who adds a touch of Franco-Floridian humor to the mix. The result is a unique blend of comedy, culture, and AI-generated absurdity.',

		'"I\'ve always had a knack for humor, but this AI-generated content has given me the perfect platform to showcase my comedic skills," Jean-Michel said. "Plus, it\'s an excellent way to bring awareness to the booming Spanish expat community in Brussels."',

		'While some critics argue that this new venture is frivolous and pointless, Jean-Michel is confident in his decision. "Why waste my days working in a cubicle when I can bring joy to people around the world with my AI-assisted humor?" he asked rhetorically.',

		'The Franco-Floridian\'s website, "Casas, Churros, and Chocolat: Spanish Homebuyers in Brussels," has already garnered a cult following, with readers praising the site\'s unique blend of humor and AI-generated narratives.',

		'"I can\'t get enough of these stories," said one fan. "It\'s like a telenovela, a sitcom, and an AI-generated fever dream all rolled into one! I never knew I needed this in my life until now."',

		'Meanwhile, Jean-Michel is busy expanding his empire. He\'s already exploring new AI-generated content themes, such as "Germans learning to Salsa dance in Dublin" and "Japanese tourists attending a Texan rodeo."',

		"For now, it seems our Franco-Floridian friend has found his niche, delighting the internet with his quirky, AI-generated articles about Spanish people buying houses in Brussels. And with the ever-growing interest in artificial intelligence, it's safe to say that Jean-Michel Florida's career change is nothing short of a humorous stroke of genius.",
