		'In a delightful twist of events, a group of American tourists, armed with their fanny packs and selfie-sticks, embarked on what they expected to be a leisurely stroll through the city of Luxembourg. Little did they know that they would stumble upon the astonishing realization that the entire country is, in fact, rather small.',

		"The group, hailing from the United States - a country so vast that it could accommodate the entirety of Luxembourg approximately 3,500 times - were genuinely flabbergasted by the size of Europe's tiniest nation. Their reaction has since gone viral, with the hashtag #LittleLuxembourg trending on social media.",

		"The tourists' epiphany struck when they inadvertently crossed the border into France while searching for a Starbucks, only to be greeted by a befuddled French border patrol officer who informed them they had, in fact, left Luxembourg behind.",

		'"I just couldn\'t believe it," said Karen McTravel, leader of the group. "We walked for like, an hour, and suddenly we\'re in a whole different country. I thought we were still in Luxembourg City!"',

		'Another member of the group, Chad Selfiestick, chimed in, "Yeah, where I come from, it takes hours just to drive across the state. Luxembourg\'s like a really cute, tiny version of America. So quaint!"',

		'The locals have taken the incident in good humor, with many Luxembourgers sharing their own anecdotes of tourists underestimating the size of their country. ',

		"<u>Disclaimer:</u> If it isn't obvious to you that this is fake news, then there is either something wrong with you, or with the world.",
