	text: [
		"In an unprecedented display of unity, world leaders convened at a top-secret summit to tackle the pressing issue of artificial intelligence (AI) and its penchant for generating an abundance of humorous stories. The outcome? A unanimous agreement to extend the age-old tradition of April Fool's Day to encompass the entire month of April.",

		'The decision came after a series of meetings that involved laughter, guffaws, and occasionally rolling on the floor. The leaders were presented with a plethora of AI-generated stories, which ranged from the mildly amusing to the downright absurd. The sheer volume of content left them with no choice but to prolong the annual day of pranks and practical jokes.',

		'A spokesperson for the summit, who chose to remain anonymous, stated, "We\'ve reached a point in history where AI has become an unstoppable force of humor. It\'s our responsibility as world leaders to recognize this phenomenon and adapt our traditions accordingly."',

		'Some of the more memorable AI-generated stories that swayed the decision included tales of cats becoming world-renowned chess champions, a newfound breed of flying penguins, and a report that claimed the moon was made of cheese – a fact that had allegedly been covered up by world governments for centuries.',

		"Critics of the decision argue that extending April Fool's Day to an entire month could lead to widespread confusion and a general erosion of trust in the media. However, proponents counter that in today's increasingly absurd world, a little extra laughter might be just what the doctor ordered.",

		'One leader, who wished to maintain anonymity, shared their thoughts on the matter: "In a world filled with conflict and division, it\'s refreshing to find something we can all agree on – laughter is indeed the best medicine."',

		"The month-long April Fool's extravaganza is set to commence next year, and world leaders have already begun to strategize ways to prank their fellow nations on a global scale. Rumors are circulating about a potential collaboration between the US and Russia to convince the world that aliens have finally arrived to share their advanced technology.",

		'Meanwhile, the tech industry is preparing for the month-long celebration by developing new AI-powered joke generators and prank apps to keep the hilarity going all month long.',

		'As the world braces for an entire month of tomfoolery, one thing is certain: thanks to the unstoppable force of AI-generated stories, we can look forward to an April filled with laughter and levity. So, buckle up, and get ready for a month of mischief, mayhem, and most importantly, mirth.',
